# The code creats tidy data from Samsung data as per course project instructions

## it first reads data files on subject, activity and features for both training and test datasets

## then it combines the test and training data

## it reads feature names from samsung data features.txt

## extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

## converts the activity variable as factor assigning text labels for each activity

## and finally, it creates a second,  independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
##  for each activity and each person.
