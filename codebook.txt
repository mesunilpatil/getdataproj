Each of these had a variable corresponding to it's mean and standard deviation 
Acc - denotes that the reading comes from accelerometer
Gyro- denotes that the reading comes from gyroscope
Body, Gravity - denotes whether the acceleration siganl is body and gravity 
Jerk - denotes Jerk signals
Mag - denote the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm 
suffix t -denotes time domain signals
suffix f -denotes frequency domain signals
X,Y,Z - are directions of 3-axial signals
mean()- in the label indicates that the original variable contained mean of the given signal
std() - in the label indicates that the original variable contained standard deviation of given signal
mean_ in the label indicates that the final variable in this modified tidy data is a mean
